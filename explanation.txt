here We analysed a fake advertising data from kaggle
The data is basically about if a certain ad is clicked or not
we first checked about the age using a distribution plot and density of area income vs age and got the rough idea where the majority of people shown the ad lies
using a paiplot we uderstood that who are using internet for less time are tend to click on the ad more 
then we checked if there is any missing data and there was no missing data
finally we made a logistic regression model and checked it's confusion matrix and it's accuracy , precision, f1 score etc.
